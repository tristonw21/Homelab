# Homelab

This repository documents my personal homelab infrastructure.

## Goals
- Learn enterprise networking and systems administration
- Build secure, zero-trust remote access
- Balance capability with power efficiency and noise
- Treat infrastructure as documentation-first

## Scope
This repo focuses on:
- Physical hardware
- Rack layout and power design
- Network topology
- Security architecture

Service-level configuration is intentionally volatile and documented separately.

## Philosophy
- Hardware is stable, software is ephemeral
- No exposed WAN services
- Everything documented before it’s forgotten

## Location
Kingfisher, Oklahoma (Home Environment)
